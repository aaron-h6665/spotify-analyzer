Analyze Your Spotify Listening Habits
Developed by CSC572: The Open Source Movement, Spring 2024-2025

## Brief Description

Spotify Analyzer is a web application that allows users to analyze their Spotify listening habits. It provides insights into the user's music preferences, including genres, artists, and tracks. Specifically, the top 5 artists, the top 5 songs, new artist discoveries, and mood trends are features that are provided. The application uses the Spotify API to fetch user data and presents it in an easy-to-understand format.

The project is built using Next.js and TypeScript, ensuring a modern and efficient development experience. The application is designed to be user-friendly, with a clean and intuitive interface.
